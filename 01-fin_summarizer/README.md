End-to-end AI Product demo: from dataset ingestion → summarization → deployment → KPI tracking.

FinSummarizer is a **Generative AI-powered tool** that transforms raw financial datasets (CSV format) and automatically generates **concise, human-readable summaries**.  
It helps **finance professionals, product teams, and decision-makers** quickly understand trends, anomalies, and key metrics without manually parsing large datasets.

This project is designed to **showcase end-to-end AI Product Management skills**, combining **technical AI implementation** with **PM artifacts** such as a sanitized PRD, KPIs, and deployment strategy.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Financial Summarization** using LLMs via LangChain.
- **Upload CSV Files** to analyze and summarize financial datasets.
- **Interactive Dashboard** built with Streamlit for seamless visualization.
- **Download Summaries** as CSV or text reports.
- **Scalable Deployment** using Docker and Streamlit Cloud.

## 🗂 Problem Statement

> Financial analysts and decision-makers spend countless hours reviewing spreadsheets and reports to identify key insights.  
>  
> **Problem:**  
> Large financial datasets are complex and time-consuming to analyze manually.  
> **Solution:**  
> FinSummarizer leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automatically generate **executive-ready summaries**, accelerating decision-making while reducing manual effort.

### **Primary KPIs**
| KPI                    | Target Value         | Why It Matters                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Summarization Accuracy | > 80%                | Ensures the summaries are reliable for decision-making. |
| Processing Speed       | < 10 sec for 1MB CSV | Smooth user experience.                                 |
| User Satisfaction      | 4.5/5+               | Measured via feedback form.                             |


## 🔄 High-Level Flow
```text
1. User Uploads CSV → Upload dataset of financial records.
2. Data Preprocessing → Clean and validate uploaded data.
3. LLM Summarization → Generate summaries using LangChain + LLM.
4. Post-Processing → Improve clarity, structure, and readability.
5. Dashboard Output → Streamlit displays summaries with download option.
6. User Downloads CSV → Summaries saved in a downloadable format.
```
