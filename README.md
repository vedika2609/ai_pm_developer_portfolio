# 🚀 AI Product Manager Portfolio – Vedika Gupta

Welcome to my **AI PM Developer Portfolio** — a curated collection of hands-on projects that blend **product strategy, AI systems design, and technical execution**.  

With 11+ years in tech & product and experience building a **Generative AI Copilot at Arcesium**, I’m now upskilling into **Agentic AI & LLMOps**   

Each project here reflects:
- **AI Agent Foundations** → building with LangChain, LangGraph, RAG  
- **LLMOps & Deployment** → scalability, monitoring, reliability  
- **Responsible AI** → bias, fairness, safety guardrails  
- **Product Management Lens** → PRDs, metrics, business impact framing
