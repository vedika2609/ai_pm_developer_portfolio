# ðŸš€ AI Product Manager Portfolio â€“ Vedika Gupta

Welcome to my **AI PM Developer Portfolio** â€” a curated collection of hands-on projects that blend **product strategy, AI systems design, and technical execution**.  

With 11+ years in tech & product and experience building a **Generative AI Copilot and MCP server at Arcesium**, Iâ€™m now upskilling into **Agentic AI, MCPs & LLMOps**   

Each project here reflects:
- **AI Agent Foundations** â†’ building with LangChain, LangGraph, RAG  
- **LLMOps & Deployment** â†’ scalability, monitoring, reliability  
- **Responsible AI** â†’ bias, fairness, safety guardrails  
- **Product Management Lens** â†’ PRDs, metrics, business impact framing
